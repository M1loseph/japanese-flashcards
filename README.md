# J(apanese) Flashcards

A simple app to support me on my japanese learning journey. I store the words I'm supposed to learn in sets I call "bags" and then start a lesson by combining any number of bags.

## Play around

The app is available at [https://japonski.dev](https://japonski.dev) using GCP hosting.

## Technologies

It uses the following technologies:

- React
- React router DOM
- Tailwind and Daisy UI for styling

## AI

This is the first project I'm trying to vibe code a bit. I'm utilizing the Copilot Agent mode inside VS Code to implement certain features.
